### Hey there! üëãüèº

I'm Michael Andrews - an Australian paramedic currently researching and developing health services in the Pacific Islands, combining my clinical knowledge with my love of technology to develop solutions to solve some of the most pressing threats to health. 

At the moment, I'm developing a Computer Aided Dispatch system for the ambulance service. A component of this includes using AI for dynamic deployment - a real-time tactical application that dynamically calculates coverage deficiencies and provides optimal move-up solutions in the emergency response environment.
